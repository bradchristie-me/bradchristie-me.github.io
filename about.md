I'm currently a Solutions Architect for Sitecore, working primarily in proof-of-concepts and pre-sales; It's my job to prove anything can be done with Sitecore (and, yes, it can). I love a good challenge and exceeding expectations, while also constantly trying to evolve and grow both professionally and academically.

I pride myself on my ability to expand my horizons. Something I wrote six months ago is many times unacceptable by my own standards because I find better (albeit speed, readability or otherwise) methods to use. I always trying new things and want to know more. Because of that I'm frequently on StackOverflow either asking or answering questions, however I feel answering to be more beneficial believe it or not. (Curious why? Ask me.)

Some Key Points:

* I was born a software developer and not taught to be one.
* I love seeing the whole picture but working out the details on the little things, too.
* I could live without refactoring (I always write it correctly the first time.)
* My code doesn't have bugs, just undocumented features.
* I believe it's important to have a sense of humor.
